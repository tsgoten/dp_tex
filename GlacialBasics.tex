\mysection{Glacial Basics}
\mysub{Aerosol:} a colloidal suspension of particles dispersed in air or gas.
\mysub{Firn:} the intermediate state between snow and glacial ice
\mysub{Accumulation:} Accumulation is when glaciers gain more mass through snowfall, windblown snow, avalanches, rime ice (freezing water vapor), refreezing meltwater.
\mysub{Ablation:} Ablation is when glaciers loose mass through surface melt, surface meltwater runoff, sublimation, avalanching and windblown snow.

\ddd Past 200 yr: CO2 went up by 40\% and Methane by 200\% - 300\%, which glaciers have the ability to combat
\ddd Reflect heat from the sun, 
\ddd increased dust and soot from grazing, farming, and burning of fossil fuels and forests, are also causing glacier retreat (albedo)
\ddd layers of dust and soot are darkening the color of glaciers and snowpacks, causing them to absorb more solar heat and melt more quickly, and earlier in spring.
\ddd \blue{Albedo}, or "whiteness," is a scientific term meaning reflectivity
\ddd Cooking stoves (biomass stoves) darken snow and ice in mountainous regions. In The himalayas this is bad because the Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong, and Ganges rivers all feed from glaciers
\ddd 90\% of Himalayan Glacier Melting Caused by Aerosols and Black Carbon
\ddd \vocab{Aerosol}: a colloidal suspension of particles dispersed in air or gas.
\textbf{reducing albedo}.
\mysub{Ocean} If glacier melted 
\mysubsub{sea level would rise by: } All of Greenland (7.2m); West Antarctic Ice Sheet (3.2m). All of Antarctica (57m). 
\ddd seal level has risen by 4 to 8 inches over the past century
\ddd rate of rise over the past 20 years has been 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year
\mysub{Lithosphere} When glaciers erode the rock underneath them, they release carbon gases trapped in the lithosphere. Also, when ice sheets weigh down on the sea floor, the cause depression in the earth's lithosphere, and the edges are called fore bulges, which are massive hills that areas like America's east coast lie upon. When these sink, the depressions left rise, causing a reshuffling of the earth's lithosphere. This is called glacial isostatic adjustment.
\vocab{basal sliding}. when the ice slides over the land with a layer of water acting as a lubricant and reducing the friction between land and ice. pressure from the weight of the ice reduces the melting point at the base of the glacier which allows the ice to melt, allowing water to be present.  glaciers can move in even the coldest of climates.
