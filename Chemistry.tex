\mysection{Chemistry of Ice}
\ddd Polar and covalent bond within the molecule. Hydrogen bonds between molecules.
\ddd Unusual properties: higher than usual melting point, density of ice relative to water (crystal structure from hydrogen bonds causing water molecules to be spaced farther apart from each other compared to the noncrystalline liquid state).
\ddd Hexagonal structure, with four hydrogen bonds on each molecule.
\ddd Hexagonal crystal family. 
\ddd Coordination number of Oxygen is 4
\ddd Another form of ice that is metastable is isometric with four 3 fold or 3 bar axes.
