	\mysection{Glacial Formation} % New Section
		\mysub {Glacial Ice:}
		Glacier formation - snow in same area year long and accumulates into masses of ice; ; after the first winter this is known as \vocab{neve}; after two winters (one melt season), snow turns into \vocab{firn}; the ice increases in density over years
		\mysub{Ice Crystal Structure:} 
		Commonly takes the shape of sheets or planes of oxygen atoms joined in a series of open hexagonal rings; ice can form 18 different crystalline phases; tacked in a laminar structure that occasionally deforms by gliding; When this gliding deformation occurs, the bonds between the layers break, and the hydrogen atoms involved in those bonds must become attached to different oxygen atoms
		\mysub{Properties of Ice:} The albedo is 0.5 to 0.9 for snow, 0.3 to 0.65 for firn, and 0.15 to 0.35 for glacier ice
		\mysubsub{Albedo:} lowers the melting point of the glacier due to hydrostatic pressure, where deeper parts of the glacier are colder
		\mysub{Moraine: }
		Material a glacier picks up or pushes as it moves forms moraines along the surface and sides of the glacier. As a glacier retreats, the ice literally melts away from underneath the moraines, so they leave long, narrow ridges that show where the glacier used to be. Glaciers do not always leave moraines behind, however, because sometimes the glacier’s own meltwater washes the material away.
		\mysub{Drumlins: } long, tear-drop-shaped sedimentary formations. What caused drumlins to form is poorly understood, but scientists believe that they were created subglacially as the ice sheets moved across the landscape during the various ice ages. Theories suggest that drumlins might have been formed as glaciers scraped up sediment from the underlying ground surface, or from erosion or deposition of sediment by glacial meltwater, or some combination of these processes. Because the till, sand, and gravel that form drumlins are deposited and shaped by glacier movement, all drumlins created by a particular glacier face the same direction, running parallel to the glacier's flow. Often, hundreds to thousands of drumlins are found in one place, looking very much like whale backs when seen from above
		\mysub{Structure: }The region near the head of the glacier where snow is converted to firn and then ice is called the zone of accumulation.  The region near the foot of the glacier is called the zone of ablation; this is where ice is lost by melting, evaporation or calving (to make icebergs).  Separating the accumulation zone from the ablation zone is the equilibrium line. The equilibrium line is located at the equilibrium line altitude (ELA).

	%Mass Balance and Flow
	\mysection{Mass-balance and Flow}
		\mysub{Ablation and Accumulation Zones:}
		\mysubsub{Accumulation Zones} are the part of the glacier that has more accumulation than ablation
		\mysubsub{Ablation Zones} are the part of the glacier that has more ablation than accumulation, and the calculate mass balance, just add the two figures
		\mysub{Equilibrium Lines} The point across a glacier where accumulation is equal to ablation; The lower the altitude of this line, the faster the glacier advances, and vice versa
		\mysub{Relation of flow to elevation and gradient:}
		\mysubsub{Gradient -} the higher the gradient, the faster the floor of the glacier; Glaciers steeper in maritime climates and temperate latitudes then in continental climates and polar latitudes.
		\mysubsub{Elevation -}Lower the altitude, the less likely it is to find a glacier; So, the lower altitude causes glaciers to be valley or piedmont glaciers rather then cirque, and more active.
    %Glacier Types and Forms
		\mysection{Glacier Types and Forms}
		\mysub{Ice Caps} have an area less than 50,000 square km
		\mysub{Ice Sheets} have an area greater than this; only extant ice sheets are in Antarctica and Greenland
		\mysub{Alpine Glaciers} Begin high in the mountains from cirques and then valley, then piedmont
		\mysubsub{Cirque Glaciers} glacial ice collected in bowl shaped depression high in the mountains 
		\mysubsub{Hanging Glaciers}  A hanging glacier originates high on the wall of a glacial valley and descends only part of the way to the surface of the main glacier and abruptly stops, typically at a cliff.
		\mysubsub{Piedmont Glaciers} valley glaciers that spread out onto a flat lowland
		\mysubsub{Tidewater Glaciers} glaciers that flow to the sea
		\mysubsub{Valley Glaciers} a thin stream of ice that takes up a valley and originates from one or many cirques
		\mysubsub{Apron Glaciers} Glaciers that cling to steep mountainsides and are very avalanche prone.
	%Glacial Features
	    \mysection{Glacial Features}  
	    \mysub{Ice Stream} section of fast flow within a glacier that make up most o the way that a glacier discharges ice and sediment.
		\mysub{Ice Shelves} a suspended section of ice connected to a landmass that forms when a glacier flows down to the ocean’s surface.
		\mysub{Ice Rise} an obvious dome shaped bump in the ice of a glacier formed when the seabed under a glacier has a similar bump, located with valley glaciers.
		\mysub{Ice Stream} a long, narrow sheet of ice that extends out over the ocean that forms when a valley glacier moves very rapidly onto the ocean.
		\mysub{Nunatak} an exposed, often rocky element of a ridge, mountain, or peak not covered with ice or snow within an ice field or glacier; also called glacial islands.
		\mysub{Crevasses} deep cracks in glacier ice caused by the stress of the ice moving over rocky terrain underneath, indicate that glacier is under different types of stress as it flows. If crevasses close up, it shows that a glacier is flowing over an area of less gradient. 
		\mysub{Ogives} alternating bands of light and dark ice that forms ridges arcs of ice bending downstream. This shows that a glacier is moving faster in the center, creating these arched bands, or is moving over steeper terrain.
		\mysub{Ice Falls} glaciers flow over an steep drop or squeeze through an narrow place characterized by rapid flow and a crevassed surface. Happens when a glacier flows over a steep surface or narrows.
	%Hydrology
	    \mysection{Hydrology}
	        \ddd Glacier hydrology is the study of the flow of water through glaciers
            \ddd Glacier ice is permeable, with a network of microscopic veins and lenses of water.
            \mysub{Glacier Permeability} 
                \ddd The rate at which water percolates through the glacier is dependent on salinity, pressure and temperature. 
                \ddd  The rate at which ice seeps through the ice, however, is so slow, that for practical reasons ice can generally be considered impermeable
            \mysub{Supraglacial (surface) water} on a glacier is formed by the ice melting during the summer.
            \mysub{Ablation}: Surface melt; occurs in hard packed snow (firn: the transistional state between snow and ice)
            \mysub{Swamp zone} If a firn becomes saturated all the way to the surface it becomes a ‘swamp zone’; Swamp zone moved up glacier as the melt season progresses.
            \ddd Much of the meltwater runoff in Antarctica is restricted to coastal areas and ice shelves during the summer seasons
            \mysub{Englacial Hydrology}
                \ddd \vocab{Moulins} are vertical shafts cut by the water.
                \ddd Water cascades down these into the ice sheet. Despite the pressures within the ice sheet, moulins remain open by constant melting by the water
            \mysub{Subglacial Hydrology}
                \ddd Basal meltwater flowing through large subglacial networks impact glacial erosion and ice velocity. 
            \mysub{Proglacial Drainage}
                \ddd Abundant meltwater can form large braided river plains, or sandur
                \ddd Runoff is less in Antarctica, and meltwater in the northern Antarctic Peninsula tends to be restricted to small braided streams
                \ddd These streams redeposit glacial sediments and rework glacial landforms
        \mysection{Laurentide Ice Sheet}
            \ddd The mass of ice in the Greenland Ice Sheet has begun to decline. From 1979 to 2006, summer melt on the ice sheet increased by 30 percent, reaching a new record in 2007
            \ddd Antartica has not shown noticeable changes. 
            \ddd Antartic peninsula has seen changes which is the part that sticks out of the continent
        \mysection{Methods of studying glaciers}
            \ddd The two main processes used to determine ablation or accumulation are \textbf{probing} and \textbf{crevasse stratigraphy}, which can give accurate measurements of snowpack thickness.
            \mysub{Probing}: researchers will place poles in the icepack at various points, at the beginning of the melt period or accumulation period. After a few months the researchers will return and look at the changes in levels of ice, by looking at the height of the ice along the pole.
            \mysub{Crevasse stratigraphy}: researchers will find crevasses, then observe the number of layers that formed. Based on the layers the researchers will be able to determine how much snow accumulated. The layers are almost like layers in a tree trunk.
            \mysub{Cosmogenic nuclide dating} is useful for directly dating rocks on the Earth’s surface. It gives an Exposure Age: that is, how long the rock has been exposed to cosmic radiation. It is effective on timescales of several millions of years. It assumes that boulders have not been buried and then re-exposed at the Earth’s surface.
            \mysub{Radiocarbon dating} dates the decay of Carbon-14 within organic matter. Organic matter needs to have been buried and preserved for this technique. It is effective for up to the last 40,000 years. It assumes that organic material is not contaminated with older radiocarbon (which, for example, is a common problem with organic material from marine sediment cores around Antarctica).
            \mysub{Amino Acid Racemisation} dates the decay and change in proteins in organisms such as shells.
            \mysub{Optically Stimulated Luminescence} dates the radiation accumulated in quartz or feldspar grains within sand. The radiation emanates from radioactive grains within the sediment, such as zircons. It is effective for hundreds of thousands of years, and dates how long the sediment has been buried.
        \mysection{Recent Records of Cryospheric Change}
            \vocab{Cryosphere}: portions of Earth’s surface where water is in solid form including sea ice, lake ice, river ice, snow cover, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, and frozen ground (which includes permafrost).
            \mysub{Larsen Ice Shelf}
                a long ice shelf in the northwest part of the Weddell Sea, extending along the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula from Cape Longing to Smith Peninsula
                \ddd The collapse of Larsen B has revealed a thriving chemotrophic ecosystem 800 m (half a mile) below the sea.
                \ddd 31 January 2002 - March 2002 Larsen B sector partially collapsed and parts broke up. 
                \ddd Larsen B was stable for 10,000 years, but due to warm currents eating away the underside of the shelf it collapsed. 
                \ddd 3,250-square-kilometer (1,255-square-mile) section collapsed (size of Rhode island)
            \mysub{Kilimanjaro}
                \ddd Kilimanjaro's shrinking northern glaciers, thought to be 10,000 years old, could disappear by 2030
                \ddd The northern ice field, which holds most of the remaining glacial ice, lost more than 140 million cubic feet of ice in the past 13 years
                \ddd Approximately 29\% of the volume and 32\% of the surface area of the ice sheet has been lost since 2000.
                \ddd No real reason is known, with possible links to global warming and less snowfall
            \mysub{Amundsen Sea Embayment}
                \ddd is located off of west Antarctica and the ice that drains into it is roughly 3 km thick
                \ddd Recently, this sheet has significantly thinned because of shifts in wind patterns that allow warmer water to flow under the ice, and is already melting enough to raise the global sea level by 0.2 mm per year. 
                \ddd Two of Antarctica's largest glaciers drain into this basin and if they were to melt, the sea level could increase by up to 3 yards. 
                \ddd The weak underbelly of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and if it were to collapse, could destabilize the entire west antarctic ice sheet
 	    \mysection{Post-Glacial Landscape}  
	 	    \mysub{Erosional Features:}
	 	    \mysubsub{Cirques} a bowl shaped basin formed when a glacier erodes under the bergschrund(a crevasse at or near the head of a glacier) which opens in the early summer, exposing the rock underneath to frost action and causes upper rock to avalanche and scour the floor beneath in the bowl shape, or the bowl left behind from a cirque glacier.
	 	    \mysubsub{Tor} a free-standing rock outcropping that abruptly rises from the surrounding environment, formed at first by erosion and weathering of the ground surrounding it.
	 	    \mysubsub{U-Shaped Valley} happen when valley glaciers advance, eroded a u-shaped depression in the land, and then recede, leaving this U-shaped valleys and mountains behind.
	 	    \mysubsub{Hanging Valley} as a smaller glacier at a higher elevation joins a lower, but larger valley glacier, and they recede, the u shaped valley created by the smaller glaciers opens up onto the lower depression formed by the larger glacier.
	 	    \mysubsub{Aretes} a sharp, crested ridge that separates the heads of two opposing cirques where glaciers used to reside and carved this thin ridge.
	 	    \mysubsub{Horns}when glaciers erode three or more aretes, ending with sharp, vertical peak.
	 	    \mysubsub{Stritations/Grooves} are carved into bedrock as glaciers pass over it.
	 	    \mysubsub{Rôche moutonnée} occurs when a glacier claws itself up a hill, it damages the surface, leaving jagged and irregular on that side, but as it slides down, it polishes the surface, leaving the other side of the same rock smooth and even.
	 	    \mysubsub{Tarn} a lake left in a bowl shaped depression by a receding cirque glacier.
	 	    \mysub{Depositional Features: }
			\mysubsub{Moraines} are rocks or sediment deposited by a glacier, typically at its edges.
			\mysubsubsub{End/Terminal} a moraine that forms at the leading edge of a glacier marking its furthest advance, formed by debris pushed to the front of a glacier.
			\mysubsubsub{Recessional} a series of ridges formed parallel to the terminal moraine and form when a glacier temporarily stops receding.
			\mysubsubsub{Lateral} a series of parallel ridges deposited along the sides of a glacier that form when frost shatters the valley walls and causes them to collapse.
			\mysubsubsub{Medial}  a ridge of a moraine that forms in the center of a valley. It forms when two glaciers meet and the debris on the edges of the adjacent valley sides join and are carried on top of the enlarged glacier.
			\mysubsubsub{Ground} an irregular blanket of sediment most often deposited by continental glaciers
			\mysubsub{Kettles} when a block of ice calves and is submerged into sediment, and subsequently melts, the hole it leaves behind is called a kettle.
			\mysubsub{Kames} a hill of sand, sediment and till that forms on top of a retreating glacier then is deposited on the land underneath as the glacier further melts.
			\mysubsub{Drumlins} an elongated hill shaped like a inverted spoon aligned with the ice flow that forms under the glacier bed and a left when the glacier retreats.
			\mysubsub{Eskers} a long ridge composed of sediment and gravel formed under a glacier when subglacial rivers in ice walled tunnels left sediment underneath then and when the retaining walls of ice melted away
			\mysubsub{Erratics} pieces of rocks that are foreign to their surroundings regarding their size and type. They are transported by glaciers for thousands of miles.
			\mysubsub{Moulins} are vertical shafts created in a glacier by waater within it.
        \mysection{History of Ice Ages}
            \mysub{Ice ages}
                \ddd An ice age is a long interval of time (millions to tens of millions of years) when global temperatures are relatively cold and large areas of the Earth are covered by continental ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Within an ice age are multiple shorter-term periods of warmer temperatures when glaciers retreat (called interglacials or interglacial cycles) and colder temperatures when glaciers advance (called glacials or glacial cycles).
                \ddd At least five major ice ages have occurred throughout Earth’s history: the earliest was over 2 billion years ago, and the most recent one began approximately 3 million years ago and continues today (yes, we live in an ice age!).
                \ddd Currently, we are in a warm interglacial that began about 11,000 years ago. The last period of glaciation, which is often informally called the “Ice Age,” peaked about 20,000 years ago. At that time, the world was on average probably about $ 10^\circ F (5^\circ C) $ colder than today, and locally as much as $ 40^\circ F (22^\circ C) $ colder.
            \mysub{What causes ice ages?}
                \ddd Many factors contribute to climate variations, including changes in ocean and atmosphere circulation patterns, varying concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and even volcanic eruptions. The following discusses key factors in (1) initiating ice ages and (2) the timing of glacial-interglacial cycles.
                \ddd One significant trigger in initiating ice ages is the changing positions of Earth’s ever-moving continents, which affect ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns. When plate-tectonic movement causes continents to be arranged such that warm water flow from the equator to the poles is blocked or reduced, ice sheets may arise and set another ice age in motion.
                \ddd Today’s ice age most likely began when the land bridge between North and South America (Isthmus of Panama) formed and ended the exchange of tropical water between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, significantly altering ocean currents.
            \mysub{How does ice build up?}
                \ddd Throughout the Quaternary period, high latitude winters have been cold enough to allow snow to accumulate. It is when the summers are cold, (i.e., summers that occur when the sun is at its farthest point in Earth's orbit), that the snows of previous winters do not melt completely. When this process continues for centuries, ice sheets begin to form. Finally, the shape of Earth's orbit also changes. At one extreme, the orbit is more circular, so that each season receives about the same amount of insolation. At the other extreme, the orbital ellipse is stretched longer, exaggerating the differences between seasons. The eccentricity of Earth's orbit also proceeds through a long cycle, which takes 100,000 years. Major glacial events in the Quaternary have coincided when the phases of axial tilt, precession of equinoxes and eccentricity of orbit are all lined up to give the northern hemisphere the least amount of summer insolation.
            \mysub{Glacial History of Quaternary}
                The Quaternary System is that lasted from the present to approximately 2.588 million years ago with the Neogene system before the Quaternary. The Quaternary System contains two series: the Holocene and the Pleistocene with the Holocene being the present. In this period, ice sheets were able to form in Greenland and Antarctica and the continents were formed to their present shape. As glaciers formed and later retreated, thousands of lakes and rivers were created all over the world. As the glaciers retreated the sea level rose and the amount of biological diversity in the oceans increased
             \mysub{Wisconsin}
             	This Wisconsin glaciation left widespread impacts on the North American landscape. The Great Lakes and the Finger Lakes were carved by ice deepening old valleys. Most of the lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin were gouged out by glaciers and later filled with glacial meltwaters. The old Teays River drainage system was radically altered and largely reshaped into the Ohio River drainage system. Other rivers were dammed and diverted to new channels, such as Niagara Falls, which formed a dramatic waterfall and gorge, when the waterflow encountered a limestone escarpment. Another similar waterfall, at the present Clark Reservation State Park near Syracuse, New York, is now dry.
     \mysection{History of Events: }
     		\mysub{Snowball Earth: }
     			\textbf{2.4 to 2.1 billion years ago} \ddd
     			\vocab{The Huronian glaciation} is the oldest ice age we know about. The Earth was just over 2 billion years old, and home only to unicellular life-forms
     			The early stages of the Huronian, from 2.4 to 2.3 billion years ago, seem to have been particularly severe, with the entire planet frozen over in the first “snowball Earth”. This may have been triggered by a 250-million-year lull in volcanic activity, which would have meant less carbon dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere, and a reduced greenhouse effect.
     		\mysub{Deep Freeze: }
     			\textbf{850 to 630 million years ago}
     			\ddd During the 200 million years of the Cryogenian period, the Earth was plunged into some of the deepest cold it has ever experienced – and the emergence of complex life may have caused it.
     			\ddd One theory is that the glaciation was triggered by the evolution of large cells, and possibly also multicellular organisms, that sank to the seabed after dying. This would have sucked CO2 out of the atmosphere, weakening the greenhouse effect and thus lowering global temperatures
     			\ddd There seem to have been two distinct Cryogenian ice ages: the so-called Sturtian glaciation between 750 and 700 million years ago, followed by the Varanger (or Marinoan) glaciation, 660 to 635 million years ago. There’s some evidence that Earth became a snowball at times during the big freezes, but researchers are still trying to work out exactly what happened.
  			\mysub{Mass Extinction: }
  				\textbf{460 to 430 million years ago}
  				\ddd Straddling the late Ordovician period and the early Silurian period, the Andean-Saharan ice age was marked by a mass extinction, the second most severe in Earth’s history.
  				\ddd The die-off was surpassed only by the gargantuan Permian extinction 250 million years ago. But as the ecosystem recovered after the freeze, it expanded, with land plants becoming common over the course of the Silurian period. And those plants may have caused the next great ice age.
			\mysub{Plants Invade the Land: }
				\textbf{360 to 260 million years ago: }
				\ddd Like the Cryogenian glaciation, the \vocab{Karoo} ice age featured two peaks in ice cover that may well have been distinct ice ages. They took place in the Mississipian period, 359 to 318 million years ago, and again in the Pennsylvanian 318 to 299 million years ago.
				\ddd These ice ages may have been the result of the expansion of land plants that followed the Cryogenian. As plants spread over the planet, they absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere and released oxygen. As a result CO2 levels fell and the greenhouse effect weakened, triggering an ice age.
				\ddd There is some evidence that the ice came and went in regular cycles, driven by changes in Earth’s orbit. If true, this would mean that the Karoo ice age operated in much the same way as the current one
			\mysub{Antartica Freezes Over: }
				\textbf{14 million years ago}
				\ddd Antarctica wasn’t always frozen. It wasn’t until around 34 million years ago that the first small glaciers formed on the tops of Antarctica’s mountains. And it was 20 million years later, when world-wide temperatures dropped by $ 8^\circ C $, that the glaciers’ ice froze onto the rock, and the southern ice sheet was born.
				\ddd This temperature drop was triggered by the rise of the Himalayas. As they grew higher they were exposed to increased weathering, which sucked CO2 out of the atmosphere and reduced the greenhouse effect.
				\ddd The northern hemisphere remained relatively ice-free for longer, with Greenland and the Arctic becoming heavily glaciated only around 3.2 million years ago.
			\mysub{Our Ice Age: }
			\ddd First, the chilly “Older Dryas” of 14,700 to 13,400 years ago transformed most of Europe from forest to tundra, like modern-day Siberia. After a brief respite, the Younger Dryas, between 12,800 to 11,500 years ago, froze Europe solid within a matter of months – probably as a result of meltwater from retreating glaciers shutting down the Atlantic Ocean’s “conveyor-belt” current, although a cometary impact has also been blamed.
			\ddd Twelve thousand years ago, the great ice sheets retreated at the beginning of the latest interglacial – the Flandrian – allowing humans to return to northern latitudes. This period has been relatively warm, and the climate relatively stable, although it has been slightly colder than the last interglacial, the Eemian, and sea levels are currently at least 3 metres lower – differences that are being closely scrutinised by researchers keen to understand how our climate will develop.
     \mysection{Glacier Fluctuations}
	        \ddd In ~1930 Milutin Milankovitch proposed that variations in three parameters of the earth's orbit caused glacial fluctuations: 
	        \ddd 1.	Orbital eccentricity - the orbit of the earth around the sun is not a circle, but is elliptical and also varies. This eccentricity is a minor cause for seasons.
	        \ddd 2.	Tilt variations in the axis of rotation (obliquity) - the tilt of the earth's rotational axis varies with time. A tilted axis is the primary cause of seasons. This varies between 22.1 and 24.5 in a 40,000 year cycle
	        \ddd 3.	Precession - the earth's axis of rotation wobbles which results in minor fluctuations in the amount of solar radiation we receive.
	        \ddd Milankovitch pacing seems to best explain glaciation events with periodicity of 100k, 40k, and 20k years. This pattern seems to fit the info on climate change found in oxygen isotope cores. However, there are some problems with the Milankovitch theories.
	        \ddd \vocab{\textbf{100,000 year Problem eccentricity}} variations have a significantly smaller impact on solar forcing than precession or obliquity and may be expected to produce the weakest effects. The greatest observed response is at the 100k year timescale, while the theoretical forcing is smaller at this scale, in regard to the ice ages. During the last 1 million years, the strongest climate signal is the 100k year cycle.
	        \ddd \vocab{\textbf{400,000 year Problem}} (aka stage 11 problem) eccentricity variations have a strong 400k year cycle. That cycle is only clearly present in climate records older than the last million years.
	        \ddd \vocab{Stage 5} problem refers to the timing of the penultimate interglacial that appears to have begun 10k years in advance of the solar forcing hypothesized to have caused it.

		\vocab{Zone of Ablation} In the lower part of a glacier where there is more ablation than accumulation  
		\vocab{Zone of Wastage: } below the snow line, where snow melting exceeds snow accumulation
		\vocab{Ablation:} refers to all processes by which snow, ice, or water in any form are lost from a glacier - the loss of snow or ice by evaporation and melting.
		\vocab{Ablation area:} is the lower region of a glacier where snow ablation exceeds snowfall.
		\vocab{Accumulation area:} is the upper region of a glacier where snow accumulation exceeds melting.
		\vocab{Albedo: }is the percentage of the incoming radiation that is reflected off a surface. An albedo of one indicates that 100 percent of the radiation is reflected. Fresh snow has a high albedo (0.7 to 0.9), indicating that 70 to 90 percent of the radiation received is reflected; glacier ice has a lower albedo of 0.2 to 0.4.
		\vocab{Cirque:} a glacially eroded basin shaped like half a bowl; a deep, steep-walled recess in a mountain, caused by glacial erosion.
		\vocab{Crevasses: }are open fissures in glacier ice. Crevasses form where the speed of the ice is variable, such as in icefalls and at valley bends.
		\vocab{Density:} is the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume. Snow has a density averaging about 0.1, firn has a density of about 0.55, and glacier ice has a density of about 0.89. The density of unmineralized fresh water is 1.
		\vocab{Equilibrium line:} is the boundary between the accumulation area and the ablation area.
		\vocab{Firn: }is old snow that has been recrystalized into a more dense substance. Snowflakes are compressed under the weight of the overlying snowpack. Individual crystal near the melting point have slick liquid edges allowing them to glide along other crystal planes and to readjust the space between them. Where the crystals touch they bond together, squeezing the air between them to the surface or into bubbles. During summer we might see the crystal metamorphosis occur more rapidly because of water percolation between the crystals. By summer's end the result is firn -- a compacted snow with the appearance of wet sugar, but with a hardness that makes it resistant to all but the most dedicated snow shovelers! Firn has a density greater than 0.55.
		\vocab{Glacial advance:} is the net movement of glacier terminus downvalley. Advance occurs when the rate of glacier flow downvalley is greater than its rate of ablation. Advances are characterized by a convex-shaped terminus.
		\vocab{Glacial drift:} is the loose and unsorted rock debris distributed by glaciers and glacial meltwaters. Rocks may be dropped in place by the melting ice; they may be rolled to the ice margins, or they may be deposited by meltwater streams. Collectively, these deposits are called glacial drift. Till refers to the debris deposited directly by the glacier. Rock debris rolls off the glacier edges and builds piles of loose unconsolidated rocks called glacier moraine. Lateral moraines form along the side of a glacier and curl into a terminal moraine.
		\vocab{Glacial flour:} is the fine-grained sediment carried by glacial rivers that results from the abrasion of rock at the glacier bed. Its presence turns lake water aqua blue or brown, depending on its parent rock type.
		\vocab{Glacial polish:} is the leveling and smoothing of rock by fine-grained debris at the glacier bed. Coarser rocks may gouge scratches called striations.
		\vocab{Glacier outburst flood:} A sudden release of melt water from a glacier or glacier-dammed lake sometimes resulting in a catastrophic flood, formed by melting of a channel or by subglacial volcanic activity.
		\vocab{Hydrothermal alteration:} is the alteration of rocks or minerals due to the reactions of geothermally heated water with minerals. The process weathers and weakens the rocks such that they may become unstable.
		\vocab{Icefalls:} are somewhat analogous to waterfalls in rivers. The flow of the ice down a steep gradient often results in crevasses and seracs.
		\vocab{Jokulhlaup:} Icelandic term for Glacial outburst floods. Jokulhlaup's are sudden outbursts of water released by a glacier. The water may be released from glacier cavities, sub-glacial lakes, and from glacier-dammed lakes in side valleys.
		\vocab{Kinematic waves:} refer to a wave of ice moving downglacier propagated by its increased thickness. The wave of ice may move at two to six times the velocity of surrounding thinner ice.
		\vocab{Lahar:} is a mudflow or debris flow originating on a volcano. Jokulhlaups (see above) often become lahars when they incorporate the rock debris that lies within their path.
		\vocab{Lateral moraine:} A moraine formed at the side of a glacier. Piles of loose unsorted rocks along the side margins of the glacier. The rocks may be pushed there by the moving ice or dumped from the glacier's rounded surface.
		\vocab{Mass balance: }describes the net gain or loss of snow and ice through a given year. It is usually expressed in terms of water gain or loss.
		\vocab{Neoglaciation:} refers to the advances made by mountain glaciers since the great Pleistocene ice age. In the Cascades the advances have occurred since 6,600 years before present.
		\vocab{Ogives:} are arc-shaped features occasionally found across the glacier surface below icefalls. They may be ridges and swales in the ice or bands of darker or lighter ice. One theory of their formation suggests that the ice is stretched and sometimes dirtied when exposed in the icefall during the high velocities of summer; it is compressed during the winter so that bands of different ice thickness form.
		\vocab{Perfectly plastic solid:} is a solid that does not deform until it reaches a critical value of stress, after which it will yield infinitely. Some glaciologists say that ice is a perfectly plastic substance. (That is, brittle and capable of cracking like a solid, yet deformable and capable of flowing at other stresses.)
		\vocab{Pleistocene:} is the period of earth's history, roughly two million years ago to about ten thousand years ago, characterized by the advance and recession of continental ice sheets.
		\vocab{Roche moutonnee:} is a small asymetrically-shaped hill formed by glacial erosion. The upper sides are rounded and smoothed and the lower sides are rough and broken due to quarrying by the glacier.
		\vocab{Seracs:} are the pinnacles of ice formed where the glacier surface is torn by sets of crevasses.
		\vocab{Striations}: are the scratches etched into the rock at the bed of a glacier. Their presence indicates grinding of sand and rock particles into the bed under considerable pressure. In some places find-grained debris polishes the bedrock to a lustrous surface finish called glacial polish.
		\vocab{Suncup}: is a small depression on a snow or firn surface formed by melting and evaporation resulting from direct exposure to the sun.
		\vocab{Trimlines}: are the sharp vegetative boundaries delimiting the upper margin of a former glaciation. The age differences of the ground surface are often visible because of different ages of the vegetation.
		\mysection{Ice Cores}
		Ice cores are cylinders of ice drilled out of an ice sheet or glacier. Most ice core records come from Antarctica and Greenland, and the longest ice cores extend to 3km in depth. The oldest continuous ice core records to date extend 123,000 years in Greenland and 800,000 years in Antarctica. Ice cores contain information about past temperature, and about many other aspects of the environment. Crucially, the ice encloses small bubbles of air that contain a sample of the atmosphere – from these it is possible to measure directly the past concentration of gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) in the atmosphere.
