Sintering& the bonding together of ice crystals
Snowdrift glacier& a semipermanent mass of firn formed by drifted snow behind obstructions or in the ground; also called a catchment glacier or a drift glacier
Snowline& The end of the zone of accumulation and start of the zone of melting
snow line& The elevation above which snow remains all year long
Solifluction& A slow, viscous, downslope flow of saturated sediment and rock debris especially in areas underlain by frozen ground.
Southern, eastern, western hemispheres& the hemispheres Antarctica is located in
Southern Ocean& the ocean that surrounds Antarctica
South Pole& the important place located in Antarctica
Splay crevasse& a crevasse pattern that forms where ice slowly spreads out sideways; commonly found near a glacier terminus
Stratified Drift& Sediment laid down by glaial meltwater (lasagna)
Striation& Grooves in bedrock gouged in by moving glaciers
Subglacial Volcano& is a volcanic form produced by subglacial eruptions or eruptions beneath the surface of a glacier or ice sheet which is then melted into a lake by the rising lava. The more distinctly flat-topped, steep-sided subglacial volcanoes are called tuyas, named after Tuya Butte in northern British Columbia by Canadian geologist Bill Mathews in 1947. Often cause Jokulhlaups.
Sub polar glacier& a glacier whose temperature regime is between polar and temperate; usually predominantly below freezing, but could experience extensive summer melt
Sun cup& Ablation hollow that develops, during intense sunshine.
Surface Hoar& Deposition of ice crystals on a surface which occurs when the temperature of the surface is colder than the air above and colder than the frost point of that air.
Surges& in the summer months when the glacier is melting there will be quick sunspots
Surging glacier& a glacier that experiences a dramatic increase in flow rate, 10 to 100 times faster than its normal rate; usually surge events last less than one year and occur periodically, between 15 and 100 years
Tabular& Thinner in one direction than the other
Tarn& a small mountain lake or pool; a mountain lake formed in a cirque excavated by a glacier. A moraine may form a natural dam below a tarn
temperature-gradient metamorphism& Process of firnification when large temperature gradients exist within the snowpack, such as within adjacent layers of snow. When all snow is fully converted to ice, the density is about 830-840 kg/cubic meter.
terminal/end moraine& Moraine deposited at the end of a glacier
Terminus& End of glacier
Terminus& the lowest end of a glacier, also called the glacier toe or glacier snout
Teton blockfault& One side bound by a normal fault on one side
Teton Fault& Normal fault
thermohaline circulation& is a part of the large-scale ocean circulation that is driven by global density gradients created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes.
Thomson crystal& a large ice crystal found in deep, stagnant water-filled cavities of a glacier
Tidewater glacier& mountain glacier that terminates in the ocean
Till& Any kind of glacial deposit
Till& The sediments deposited directly by a glacier;
Tongue& a projection of the ice edge up to several km in length caused by wind and current; usually forms when a valley glacier moves very quickly into a lake or ocean
Tor& A high rock, a high rocky hill, or pile of rocks.
Trans antarctic mountains& the natural border between East and West Antarctica
Tributary glacier& a small glacier that flows into a larger glacier
Tuya& Volcanos which erupted beneath glaciers, melts through the ice above and finishes with a subaerial lava flow are called "tuyas" after the type locality, Tuya Butte, Stikine Belt, Northwest British Columbia, Canada. Also called "table mountains," the typical flat-top is created by the explosive interaction of hot magmas and lavas with water and ice. Tuyas reveal the height of the ice at the time of eruption and may be used as part of correlative dating. Similar volcanic structures, called "guyots" or "sea mounts," are created under the oceans when magma hits ocean water.
U-shaped valley& The shape of a valley formed by the erosion of a glacier
Valley glacier& a mountain glacier whose flow is confined by valley walls
Varve& A pair of thin layers deposited during a single year in a lake. One layer consists of silt brought in during spring floods and the other of clay deposited in winter when the lake's surface freezes over and the water is still.
Ventifact& A faceted or triangular-shaped stone formed by sandblasting in strong winds, often highly polished.
Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW)& is a water standard defining the isotopic composition of fresh water.
Vinson Massif& highest mountain peak in Antarctica
Wave ogives& ogives that show some vertical relief on a glacier; usually the dark bands are in the hollows and the light bands are in the ridges; form at the base of steep, narrow ice falls
Weathered ice& glacier ice that has been exposed to sun or warm wind so that the boundaries between ice crystals are partly disintegrated
Weddell Sea& the sea that is north of Antarctica
Wet Bottom Glacier& A glacier with a thin layer of water at its base, over which the glacier slides, also called a temperate glacier. Occur in regions where atmospheric temperatures become warm enough for glacial ice to be at or near its melting point.
whale& animal at the top of the Antarctic food web
Whaleback& similar to a roche moutonnée, but on a larger scale.
Where do you find trees and why?& You find trees at glacial moraines because it has clay, which retains water
White-Out& A weather condition in which the horizon cannot be identified and there are no shadows. White snow blends everywhere. All you see is white. (I've been there before, it's scary. Michaelene Cutro)
Wurm& European glaciation related to North American Wisconsinan glaciation.
Zone of Ablation In the lower part of a glacier where there is more ablation than accumulation& 
Zone of Accumulation& In the upper part of the glacier where there is more accumulation than ablation
zone of accumulation& The part of a glacial system where snow and ice are accumulating faster than they are melting away.
Zone of Fracture& The upper 50 meters of glacial ice is brittle and is carried by the ice below it.
Zone of plastic flow& The lower part of the glacier that has the ability to flow due to pressure
Zone of Wastage& below the snow line, where snow melting exceeds snow accumulation
